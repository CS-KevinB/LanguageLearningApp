# CSCE247-LanguageLearningApp

## Purpose

This language-learning app is designed to allow non-native Spanish speakers to learn the language with ease. The app will motivate both casual and advanced users to continue learning more. Around the world, there are 1.2 billion people attempting to learn a new language, which is why we want to create an app that can appeal to every learner. Studies show that people who know more than one language, even if they arenâ€™t fluent, earn up to 15% more than those who are monolingual. With features like a text-to-speech function, user-specific profiles, and daily streaks, we want our app to influence users to take advantage of the benefits of language learning with an interface that is easy to use and understand.
